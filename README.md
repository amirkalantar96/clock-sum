# Clock-Sum
**Calculating the Time Difference Between Two Clocks**

## Description of the project
- 📌 This is a small web-based project made by me.
- 🕒 It is designed to add two clocks and calculate the difference between them.
- 🌐 The interface is in Farsi, but you can easily 🌍 translate it into your own language.
- 📱💻 I’ve tried to make this project accessible on all devices and 🧭 compatible with all modern browsers.
